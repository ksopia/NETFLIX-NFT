# Binance Hackathon: The Future Is Now - Introducing " NETFLIX NFT " from Team CenterPrime.

## Overview
Our project contributes to the content industry by converting various content
formats (movies, music, photographs, documents) into NFT tokens.
Until now, the blockchain industry has been represented by financial services.
However, in the real economy, content services are also important. To date, content
services using NFT tokens have been stored on or linked to other chain networks,
making it difficult to assess their actual value. Therefore, we have created a
technology that can easily make content usable in the blockchain network. We also
want to make changes to the NFT by tokenizing the actual content, not simply
storing or exchanging FT or NFT tokens.

## Challenges
We have set six challenges for the revolution of the new blockchain content industry.

1. Distribution of data issued per each NFT token
2. Data re-decode per each NFT token
3. Purchase an NFT token by exchanging it with an FT token
4. NFT token pricing and fundraising using liquidity pool
5. Streaming pool to which NFT token content can be streamed
6. NFT token streaming service that be spent on Netflix content

##Future
The technology we provide will provide the following benefits in the future.

1. Expansion of the blockchain content industry
2. Transparent content value calculation through NFT tokens
3. Expansion of the fund-raising market for content development
4. Consumer management systems of content platforms
5. Profit diversification through NFT token liquidity
6. Providing a variety of payment services
